# nodeJSCheckpoint

The goal of this repo is  to demonstrate that I understand how to use and employ fundamental nodeJS concepts 

- parsingCLI commands 
- creating Http requests
- handling Http incoming request using expressJS 
- file manipultion through cli
- mini cli projects such as a simple calculator nodejs script 

Some of these may be simple in nature but I hope to continue to add to this repo with increasingly complex items
